README_UNET.txt


for the semantic segmentation there wasn't much time left, I tried to adapt the UNET 
Model developped previously to a new model that can detect the 11 different classes

even the data splitting was done manualy there isn't a python file that can split the data
randomly no matter the size of it (like previously done in the yolov5 training)

due to the deadline restriction this folder contains unfinshed and non functional code
